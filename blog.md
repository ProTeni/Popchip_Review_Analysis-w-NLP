I took a course on NLP by ....the Lead Data Scientist at Maven.

Where I learnt and understoodhow to firstly to create new environemnst for any new project 9assuming i was worjking with several clients or across several projects with diff requiremnenbt dependencies).

So, new envirnomenrts were created for all the nlp projects. I aslso learnt and practicaced by myself on the Ppochips dataset (from Kaggle) holistic Text OPreprocessing (tokenizaton, lemmatization, stop wordsPOs- if tghe need be) using the apply fu8nction and creating functions & Pipleines for th text preprocessing- list comprehension [token.lemma_ for token in doc  if not token is_stop]

and in some cases if a POS is neeced like the verb or noun part of speech- then to have the if conditional statemnebnt reflect that.


On the flip side, Spacy could be used ij textprepocessing - faster- without having to writye a function
